# TASK-5: Add a basic `App` component that renders a placeholder layout and a smoke test that mounts `App` without errors; run tests and ensure green.

**Section**: 0. Repo & Environment Setup
**Subsection**: 0.X
**Task ID**: TASK-5

## Description

5. Add a basic `App` component that renders a placeholder layout and a smoke test that mounts `App` without errors; run tests and ensure green.

This task is part of the migration plan to build `cursor-executor-front`, a new React + TypeScript application that will host conversation and task views migrated from the legacy UI. The application will use TanStack Query for server state management and TanStack Router (or React Router) for routing.

**IMPORTANT: Implementation Location**

All changes for this task must be made in the `cursor-executor-front` application located at `python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-front/`. Do not make changes in the `jarek-va-ui` application.

## Current State

- Testing framework is configured (from task 4)
- Need to create a basic App component with placeholder layout
- Need to write a smoke test to verify the app mounts correctly
- main.tsx exists from Vite template but needs App component

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites (tasks 1-4 should be completed)
- [ ] Review API documentation from task 9 (if applicable)
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create basic App component
  - [ ] Create `src/App.tsx` with functional component
  - [ ] Include basic structure: header element, main content area
  - [ ] Add placeholder text like "Cursor Executor Front"
  - [ ] Export the component as default
- [ ] Step 2: Wire App into main entry point
  - [ ] Update `src/main.tsx` to import App component
  - [ ] Use React 18's `createRoot` API: `createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />)`
  - [ ] Ensure StrictMode is used if desired
- [ ] Step 3: Write smoke test
  - [ ] Create `src/App.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Import React, render from @testing-library/react, and App component
  - [ ] Write test: `it('renders without crashing', () => { render(<App />); })`
  - [ ] Use `screen.getByText` to verify placeholder text is rendered
- [ ] Step 4: Run tests and verify
  - [ ] Run `npm test` (or `npm test -- --run` for single run)
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass (green)
  - [ ] Fix any issues if tests fail
  - [ ] Verify app can be started with `npm run dev` (optional manual check)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All tests must pass
- [ ] Test coverage should meet project standards
- [ ] Tests should be maintainable and well-documented
- [ ] Tests should use appropriate testing patterns (arrange-act-assert)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully
- [ ] Handle missing or invalid data
- [ ] Handle edge cases specific to this task
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages
- [ ] Handle loading states appropriately
- [ ] Handle empty states where applicable

### Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests if applicable
- [ ] Test error handling paths
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify test coverage: `npm run test:coverage` (if applicable)
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files
- [ ] Document any breaking changes (if applicable)
- [ ] Update architecture documentation if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place
- [ ] Verify performance considerations (if applicable)

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 0: Repo & Environment Setup
- **Execution Timing**: This task should be executed after completing tasks 1-4
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Tasks 2, 3, 4 must be completed first
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow the patterns established in the existing jarek-va-ui application where applicable
  - Ensure consistency with the overall architecture plan
  - Consider future tasks when making design decisions
  - Reference the master-plan.md for overall context
- **Task Independence**: This task can be completed independently once dependencies are met
- **Current State**: See "Current State" section above

### User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to complete this task so that:
- The functionality described in the task is implemented and working
- The code is well-tested with automated tests
- The implementation follows project standards and best practices
- The changes are committed and pushed to the repository
- Future tasks can build upon this work

**As a user** (for UI-related tasks), I want:
- The feature to work as expected
- The UI to be responsive and accessible
- Error states to be handled gracefully

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Implementation Complete**
   - All code changes are implemented as specified in the task description
   - Code follows project conventions and style guide
   - All functionality works as expected
   - Code is properly typed with TypeScript (no `any` types unless necessary)

2. **Automated Tests**
   - Unit tests are written and passing for all new functionality
   - Integration tests are written where applicable
   - Test coverage meets project requirements (aim for >80% for new code)
   - All tests pass: `npm test` (or equivalent)
   - Type checking passes: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
   - Linting passes: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
   - No test warnings or errors

3. **Code Quality**
   - Code is reviewed and follows best practices
   - Error handling is implemented appropriately
   - Edge cases are handled
   - No regressions introduced
   - Code is maintainable and well-documented

4. **Documentation**
   - Code is properly commented with JSDoc/TSDoc where helpful
   - Documentation is updated as needed
   - Any breaking changes are documented
   - README or relevant docs are updated if project structure changes

5. **Git Commit and Push**
   - All changes are committed to git with a descriptive commit message
   - Commit message follows project conventions: `TASK-5: Add a basic `App` component that renders a placeholder layout and a smoke test that mounts `App` without errors; run tests and ensure green.`
   - Code is pushed to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
   - Commit includes all relevant files (source code, tests, documentation, config)
   - Commit is atomic (all related changes together)

### Final Verification
