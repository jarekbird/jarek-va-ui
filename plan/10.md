# TASK-10: In `cursor-executor-front`, create a `src/types/conversation.ts` file and define TypeScript types for:

**Section**: 2. Front-end Data Types
**Subsection**: 2.X
**Task ID**: TASK-10

## Description

10. In `cursor-executor-front`, create a `src/types/conversation.ts` file and define TypeScript types for:
    - `ConversationSummary` (fields for list view).
    - `Conversation` (full detail, including messages and metadata).
    - `Message` (role, content, timestamps, ids).

This task is part of the migration plan to build `cursor-executor-front`, a new React + TypeScript application that will host conversation and task views migrated from the legacy UI. The application will use TanStack Query for server state management and TanStack Router (or React Router) for routing.

**IMPORTANT: Implementation Location**

All changes for this task must be made in the `cursor-executor-front` application located at `python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-front/`. Do not make changes in the `jarek-va-ui` application.

## Current State

- Previous tasks (1-9) have been completed
- Ready to proceed with this task
- All prerequisites and dependencies are in place

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites (tasks 1-9 should be completed)
- [ ] Review API documentation from task 9 (if applicable)
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create types directory and file
  - [ ] Create `src/types/` directory if it doesn't exist
  - [ ] Create `src/types/conversation.ts` file
- [ ] Step 2: Define ConversationSummary type
  - [ ] Based on API docs, define interface with fields for list view
  - [ ] Include: id, title (or summary), createdAt, updatedAt, status, user/agent info
  - [ ] Use appropriate TypeScript types (string, number, Date, etc.)
- [ ] Step 3: Define Conversation type
  - [ ] Extend ConversationSummary with full detail fields
  - [ ] Include messages array
  - [ ] Include all metadata fields from API
- [ ] Step 4: Define Message type
  - [ ] Create interface with: id, role (enum: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system'), content, timestamp
  - [ ] Include any additional fields from API (metadata, etc.)
- [ ] Step 5: Export all types
  - [ ] Export ConversationSummary, Conversation, and Message
  - [ ] Export any enums or union types used

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Types must match API response structures exactly
- [ ] Types should be exported for use in other modules
- [ ] Types should include JSDoc comments for complex fields
- [ ] Types should use appropriate TypeScript features (enums, unions, etc.)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully
- [ ] Handle missing or invalid data
- [ ] Handle edge cases specific to this task
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages
- [ ] Handle loading states appropriately
- [ ] Handle empty states where applicable

### Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests if applicable
- [ ] Test error handling paths
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify test coverage: `npm run test:coverage` (if applicable)
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files
- [ ] Document any breaking changes (if applicable)
- [ ] Update architecture documentation if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place
- [ ] Verify performance considerations (if applicable)

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 2: Front-end Data Types
- **Execution Timing**: This task should be executed after completing tasks 1-9
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Tasks 7, 8, 9 must be completed first
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow the patterns established in the existing jarek-va-ui application where applicable
  - Ensure consistency with the overall architecture plan
  - Consider future tasks when making design decisions
  - Reference the master-plan.md for overall context
- **Task Independence**: This task can be completed independently once dependencies are met
- **Current State**: See "Current State" section above

## Definition of Done

This task is a **CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS** task.

### User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to complete this task so that:
- The functionality described in the task is implemented and working
- The code is well-tested with automated tests
- The implementation follows project standards and best practices
- The changes are committed and pushed to the repository
- Future tasks can build upon this work

**As a user** (for UI-related tasks), I want:
- The feature to work as expected
- The UI to be responsive and accessible
- Error states to be handled gracefully

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Implementation Complete**
   - All code changes are implemented as specified in the task description
   - Code follows project conventions and style guide
   - All functionality works as expected
   - Code is properly typed with TypeScript (no `any` types unless necessary)

2. **Automated Tests**
   - Unit tests are written and passing for all new functionality
   - Integration tests are written where applicable
   - Test coverage meets project requirements (aim for >80% for new code)
   - All tests pass: `npm test` (or equivalent)
   - Type checking passes: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
   - Linting passes: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
   - No test warnings or errors

3. **Code Quality**
   - Code is reviewed and follows best practices
   - Error handling is implemented appropriately
   - Edge cases are handled
   - No regressions introduced
   - Code is maintainable and well-documented

4. **Documentation**
   - Code is properly commented with JSDoc/TSDoc where helpful
   - Documentation is updated as needed
   - Any breaking changes are documented
   - README or relevant docs are updated if project structure changes

5. **Git Commit and Push**
   - All changes are committed to git with a descriptive commit message
   - Commit message follows project conventions: `TASK-10: In `cursor-executor-front`, create a `src/types/conversation.ts` file and define TypeScript types for:`
   - Code is pushed to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
   - Commit includes all relevant files (source code, tests, documentation, config)
   - Commit is atomic (all related changes together)

### Final Verification

Before marking this task as complete, verify:
- [ ] All automated tests pass (`npm test`)

2. Code is pushed to origin
3. All tests pass
4. All acceptance criteria are met

**DO NOT mark as complete if:**
- Tests are failing
- Code is not committed
- Code is not pushed to origin
- Type errors exist
