# TASK-11: Create a `src/types/task.ts` file and define:

**Section**: 2. Front-end Data Types
**Subsection**: 2.X
**Task ID**: TASK-11

## Description

11. Create a `src/types/task.ts` file and define:
    - `TaskSummary` (fields for list view).
    - `Task` (full detail, including status, logs, related conversation id).
    - Any related types such as `ExecutionLogEntry` or status enums.

**IMPORTANT: Implementation Location**

All changes for this task must be made in the `cursor-executor-front` application located at `python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-front/`. Do not make changes in the `jarek-va-ui` application.

## Current State

- Previous tasks (1-10) have been completed
- Ready to proceed with this task
- All prerequisites and dependencies are in place

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites (tasks 1-10 should be completed)
- [ ] Review API documentation from task 9 (if applicable)
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create task types file
  - [ ] Create `src/types/task.ts` file
- [ ] Step 2: Define TaskSummary type
  - [ ] Based on API docs, define interface for list view
  - [ ] Include: id, title/description, status, createdAt, updatedAt, conversationId
- [ ] Step 3: Define Task type
  - [ ] Extend TaskSummary with full detail
  - [ ] Include: status details, execution logs, related conversation id, metadata
- [ ] Step 4: Define related types
  - [ ] Create ExecutionLogEntry type if logs are structured
  - [ ] Create TaskStatus enum: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'
  - [ ] Include any other related types from API
- [ ] Step 5: Export all types
  - [ ] Export TaskSummary, Task, ExecutionLogEntry, TaskStatus, etc.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Types must match API response structures exactly
- [ ] Types should be exported for use in other modules
- [ ] Types should include JSDoc comments for complex fields
- [ ] Types should use appropriate TypeScript features (enums, unions, etc.)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully
- [ ] Handle missing or invalid data
- [ ] Handle edge cases specific to this task
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages
- [ ] Handle loading states appropriately
- [ ] Handle empty states where applicable

### Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests if applicable
- [ ] Test error handling paths
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify test coverage: `npm run test:coverage` (if applicable)
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files
- [ ] Document any breaking changes (if applicable)
- [ ] Update architecture documentation if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place
- [ ] Verify performance considerations (if applicable)

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 2: Front-end Data Types
- **Execution Timing**: This task should be executed after completing tasks 1-10
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Tasks 8, 9, 10 must be completed first
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow the patterns established in the existing jarek-va-ui application where applicable
  - Ensure consistency with the overall architecture plan
  - Consider future tasks when making design decisions
  - Reference the master-plan.md for overall context
- **Task Independence**: This task can be completed independently once dependencies are met
- **Current State**: See "Current State" section above

## Definition of Done

This task is a **CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS** task.

### User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to complete this task so that:
- The functionality described in the task is implemented and working
- The code is well-tested with automated tests
- The implementation follows project standards and best practices
- The changes are committed and pushed to the repository
- Future tasks can build upon this work

**As a user** (for UI-related tasks), I want:
- The feature to work as expected
- The UI to be responsive and accessible
- Error states to be handled gracefully

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Implementation Complete**
   - All code changes are implemented as specified in the task description
   - Code follows project conventions and style guide
   - All functionality works as expected
   - Code is properly typed with TypeScript (no `any` types unless necessary)

2. **Automated Tests**
   - Unit tests are written and passing for all new functionality
   - Integration tests are written where applicable
   - Test coverage meets project requirements (aim for >80% for new code)
   - All tests pass: `npm test` (or equivalent)
   - Type checking passes: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
   - Linting passes: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
   - No test warnings or errors

3. **Code Quality**
   - Code is reviewed and follows best practices
   - Error handling is implemented appropriately
   - Edge cases are handled
   - No regressions introduced
   - Code is maintainable and well-documented

4. **Documentation**
   - Code is properly commented with JSDoc/TSDoc where helpful
   - Documentation is updated as needed
   - Any breaking changes are documented
   - README or relevant docs are updated if project structure changes

5. **Git Commit and Push**
   - All changes are committed to git with a descriptive commit message
   - Commit message follows project conventions: `TASK-11: Create a `src/types/task.ts` file and define:`
   - Code is pushed to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
   - Commit includes all relevant files (source code, tests, documentation, config)
   - Commit is atomic (all related changes together)

### Final Verification

Before marking this task as complete, verify:
- [ ] All automated tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Code is committed to git with descriptive message
- [ ] Code is pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit message follows conventions
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] No blocking issues remain

**The task is NOT complete until:**
1. All code is committed to git
2. Code is pushed to origin
3. All tests pass
4. All acceptance criteria are met

**DO NOT mark as complete if:**
- Tests are failing
- Code is not committed
- Code is not pushed to origin
- Type errors exist
- Linting errors exist
