# TASK-TD-004: Add Task Dashboard Route and Navigation Entry

**Section**: 3. Route and Shell Setup
**Subsection**: 3.1
**Task ID**: TASK-TD-004
**Order**: 004

## Description

This task creates the initial route structure for the Task Dashboard in `cursor-executor-front`. It establishes the `/task-dashboard` route, creates a placeholder page component, and adds navigation to access it. This provides the foundation for implementing the full dashboard in subsequent tasks.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-front/src/routes/conversations/ConversationsPage.tsx`
- `python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-front/src/App.tsx`

## Current State

- `cursor-executor-front` has a working routing setup using React Router
- Existing route: `/conversations` (ConversationsPage)
- App.tsx contains route configuration
- No Task Dashboard route exists yet
- Navigation may or may not exist (to be determined)

**Important**: This task creates a minimal placeholder. Full dashboard implementation comes in later tasks.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Navigate to `python-cursor/cursor-executor/cursor-executor-front` directory
- [ ] Ensure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- [ ] Review `src/App.tsx` to understand routing structure
- [ ] Review `src/routes/conversations/ConversationsPage.tsx` as a pattern
- [ ] Review `src/routes/conversations/ConversationsPage.css` for styling patterns

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create route directory structure
  - [ ] Create directory: `src/routes/task-dashboard/`
  - [ ] Verify directory was created successfully
- [ ] Step 2: Create TaskDashboardPage component
  - [ ] Create `src/routes/task-dashboard/TaskDashboardPage.tsx`
  - [ ] Import React
  - [ ] Create functional component `TaskDashboardPage`
  - [ ] Add root container with `data-testid="task-dashboard-page"`
  - [ ] Add placeholder content (e.g., "Task Dashboard - Coming Soon")
  - [ ] Export component as default
- [ ] Step 3: Create TaskDashboardPage CSS
  - [ ] Create `src/routes/task-dashboard/TaskDashboardPage.css`
  - [ ] Add basic styling for the page container
  - [ ] Ensure it follows existing CSS patterns from ConversationsPage
- [ ] Step 4: Register route in App.tsx
  - [ ] Open `src/App.tsx`
  - [ ] Import `TaskDashboardPage` component
  - [ ] Add new Route: `<Route path="/task-dashboard" element={<TaskDashboardPage />} />`
  - [ ] Place route in appropriate location (after conversations route)
- [ ] Step 5: Add navigation (if navigation exists)
  - [ ] Check if navigation component exists (e.g., in Layout or App)
  - [ ] If navigation exists:
    - [ ] Add link to Task Dashboard
    - [ ] Use React Router's `Link` component
    - [ ] Set `to="/task-dashboard"`
    - [ ] Add appropriate label (e.g., "Task Dashboard")
  - [ ] If navigation doesn't exist:
    - [ ] Document that navigation will be added in a future task
    - [ ] Note that route is accessible via direct URL

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Route component structure
  - [ ] Component follows same pattern as ConversationsPage
  - [ ] Component is a functional component using React hooks
  - [ ] Component has proper TypeScript types
  - [ ] Component exports as default
- [ ] Requirement 2: Route registration
  - [ ] Route path is `/task-dashboard`
  - [ ] Route uses React Router's `Route` component
  - [ ] Route is registered in App.tsx Routes
  - [ ] Route is accessible via URL navigation
- [ ] Requirement 3: Styling
  - [ ] CSS file follows naming convention (TaskDashboardPage.css)
  - [ ] CSS uses consistent patterns with existing routes
  - [ ] Page container has appropriate styling
- [ ] Requirement 4: Testability
  - [ ] Component has `data-testid` attribute for testing
  - [ ] Component structure allows for easy testing

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Component handles rendering without errors
- [ ] Route handles direct navigation (typing URL)
- [ ] Route handles navigation from other routes
- [ ] CSS doesn't break existing page layouts

### Testing

- [ ] Step 1: Create test file
  - [ ] Create `src/routes/task-dashboard/TaskDashboardPage.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary testing utilities (React Testing Library, etc.)
  - [ ] Import component to test
- [ ] Step 2: Write basic rendering test
  - [ ] Test: Component renders without crashing
  - [ ] Test: Component contains root container with `data-testid="task-dashboard-page"`
  - [ ] Test: Component displays placeholder content
- [ ] Step 3: Write routing test
  - [ ] Test: Route is accessible via React Router
  - [ ] Test: Navigating to `/task-dashboard` renders TaskDashboardPage
  - [ ] Use React Router's `MemoryRouter` in tests if needed
- [ ] Step 4: Run tests
  - [ ] Run: `npm test` (or `npm test TaskDashboardPage`)
  - [ ] Verify: All tests pass
  - [ ] Verify: Test coverage is adequate

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments in TaskDashboardPage.tsx
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comment describing the component
  - [ ] Note that this is a placeholder for full implementation
- [ ] Update README.md (if it documents routes)
  - [ ] Add entry for `/task-dashboard` route
  - [ ] Note that it's under development

### Verification

- [ ] Verify route is accessible in development
  - [ ] Run: `npm run dev`
  - [ ] Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/task-dashboard` (or appropriate port)
  - [ ] Verify: Page renders without errors
- [ ] Verify route works via navigation (if navigation was added)
  - [ ] Click navigation link
  - [ ] Verify: Route changes and page renders
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings

## Notes

- This task is part of the Task Dashboard React/TanStack Port project
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed after TASK-TD-002 and TASK-TD-003, before component implementation tasks
- **Dependencies**:
  - TASK-TD-002: Provides understanding of routing patterns
  - TASK-TD-003: Provides understanding of backend contracts (for future reference)
- **Important Considerations**:
  - This is a minimal placeholder - full implementation comes later
  - Follow existing route patterns for consistency
  - Ensure route doesn't conflict with existing routes
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after dependencies
- **Current State**: No Task Dashboard route exists yet
