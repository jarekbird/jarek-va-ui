# Implement MVP Cursor Completion → Agent Push Flow

- **Scope:** `elevenlabs-agent`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - In the callback route, construct the MVP `input_text` message with a simple textual summary.
  - Push the message to ElevenLabs using the stored `wsUrl` or equivalent.
  - Log any errors without crashing the service.
  - Confirm that the agent speaks/responds to the pushed completion message.
  - Add tests that simulate callback payloads and assert that the correct message body would be sent to ElevenLabs (mocking the network layer).
