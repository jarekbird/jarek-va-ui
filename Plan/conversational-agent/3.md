# Rename Conversations to “Note Taking History” in UI Only

- **Scope:** `jarek-va-ui`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - Update labels in `ConversationListView.tsx` from “Conversation History” to “Note Taking History`.
  - Update headings and labels in `ConversationDetails.tsx` and `ConversationDetailView.tsx`.
  - Adjust any references in `App.tsx` or routing components that show “Conversations” in titles.
  - Update comments in `src/api/conversations.ts` and `src/types/index.ts` to clarify “note-taking” purpose.
  - Manually verify that endpoints remain `/conversations/api/*` and that behavior is unchanged.
  - Update or add component tests that assert the new labels while confirming that data loading behavior is unchanged.
