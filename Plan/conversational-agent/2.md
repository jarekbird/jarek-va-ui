# Verify Current Conversation & Note-Taking Flows

- **Scope:** `cursor-runner`, `jarek-va-ui`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - Trace how `cursor:conversation:{conversationId}` is created and read in `cursor-runner`.
  - Confirm `jarek-va-ui` conversation list/detail screens and their dependency on `/conversations/api/*`.
  - Capture baseline behavior (screenshots or notes) for regression comparison.
  - Add or review minimal automated tests that exercise `/conversations/api/*` list/detail flows so that the current behavior is locked in before renaming.
