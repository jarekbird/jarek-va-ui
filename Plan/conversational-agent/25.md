# Implement Basic Voice Service Connection Flow

- **Scope:** `jarek-va-ui`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - Implement `src/services/elevenlabs-voice.ts`:
    - Initialize ElevenLabs SDK and create a connection to the agent.
    - Manage microphone permission requests.
    - Expose `startVoiceSession` and `endVoiceSession`.
  - Integrate use of `getVoiceSignedUrl` when agent is private.
  - Ensure service respects `VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ENABLED` flag.
  - Add unit tests (or integration-style tests with a mocked SDK) to verify basic connect/disconnect flows and state transitions.
