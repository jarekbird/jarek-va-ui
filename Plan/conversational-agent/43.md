# Perform End-to-End Happy Path Manual Test

## Scope
All services.

## Subtasks
- Start the full stack (Redis, cursor-runner, elevenlabs-agent, jarek-va-ui).
- Open an agent conversation, start voice, and exchange messages.
- Trigger a cursor-based tool from the agent and observe:
  - Async execution.
  - Callback to elevenlabs-agent.
  - Completion message delivered back to the agent and voiced to the user.

## Desired Outcomes

### Primary Outcomes
1. **End-to-End Validation**: Complete system works from user interaction to agent response.

2. **Integration Verification**: All services communicate correctly in the full stack.

3. **User Experience Confirmation**: Happy path provides good user experience.

4. **Documentation**: Test results documented for future reference.

### Success Criteria
- Full stack starts successfully
- Voice session connects
- Messages exchanged successfully
- Cursor tool triggered
- Async execution works
- Callback received
- Completion message delivered
- Agent responds naturally
- Test documented

## User Stories

### As a User
- **Story 1**: I want the full system to work so that I can use voice agents with cursor integration.

### As a QA Engineer
- **Story 2**: I want to verify the happy path so that I know the system works end-to-end.

## Suggested Automated Tests

### E2E Tests (Future)
1. **Full Flow Test**:
   ```typescript
   describe('End-to-End Flow', () => {
     it('completes full voice → cursor → callback flow', async () => {
       // Full stack E2E test
     });
   });
   ```

### Manual Test Checklist
2. **Test Checklist**:
   - [ ] All services start
   - [ ] Voice session connects
   - [ ] Messages exchange
   - [ ] Cursor tool triggered
   - [ ] Callback received
   - [ ] Completion delivered
   - [ ] Agent responds

## Inherent Risks

### High Risk
1. **Integration Failures**:
   - **Risk**: Services don't communicate correctly
   - **Mitigation**: Test each integration point, clear error messages, logging

2. **Timing Issues**:
   - **Risk**: Race conditions or timing problems in full flow
   - **Mitigation**: Proper async handling, timeouts, retry logic

### Medium Risk
3. **Environment Differences**:
   - **Risk**: Works in test but not production
   - **Mitigation**: Test in production-like environment, monitor production

### Low Risk
4. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - **Risk**: Test results not documented
   - **Mitigation**: Document results, create test reports, update docs
