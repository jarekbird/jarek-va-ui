# Update ElevenLabs Dashboard Configuration and Validate Integration

- **Scope:** ElevenLabs dashboard config, `elevenlabs-agent`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - Update the ElevenLabs agent configuration to point the webhook URL at the new `elevenlabs-agent` service (via Traefik).
  - Ensure the correct secret (`WEBHOOK_SECRET` or equivalent) is configured on both ElevenLabs and `elevenlabs-agent`.
  - Trigger a test interaction from the ElevenLabs dashboard to confirm that requests reach `/agent-tools` and are handled successfully.
  - Verify that cursor-powered tools invoked by the agent follow the async flow and result in completion messages being pushed back to the agent.
