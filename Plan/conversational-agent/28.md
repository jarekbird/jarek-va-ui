# Implement Network Failure Handling in Voice Service

- **Scope:** `jarek-va-ui`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - Use `retryWithBackoff` to implement reconnection with exponential backoff.
  - Implement heartbeat messages and health checks at 30-second intervals.
  - Add timeouts for initial connection and ongoing operations.
  - Detect dropped audio, partial transcripts, and stuck speaking modes per plan.
  - Add fallback logic for missing `onModeChange` events.
  - Add automated tests (where feasible with mocks/fakes) that simulate failure modes and assert retries, state transitions, and user-facing error signals.
