# Wire Agent Conversations into Global Navigation and Routing

## Scope
`jarek-va-ui`.

## Subtasks
- Add an "Agent Conversations" entry in the main navigation.
- Ensure note-taking and agent conversation routes are clearly separated.
- Provide clear breadcrumbs or page titles for each mode.

## Desired Outcomes

### Primary Outcomes
1. **Navigation Integration**: Agent conversations accessible from main navigation, making the feature discoverable.

2. **Route Separation**: Clear separation between note-taking and agent conversation routes, preventing confusion.

3. **Clear Context**: Breadcrumbs and page titles make it clear which mode the user is in.

4. **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation follows existing app patterns for familiarity.

### Success Criteria
- "Agent Conversations" in main navigation
- Routes clearly separated (/note-taking vs /agent-conversations)
- Breadcrumbs show correct context
- Page titles accurate
- Navigation works correctly
- No route conflicts
- Tests cover navigation flows

## User Stories

### As a User
- **Story 1**: I want to find agent conversations easily so that I can access them quickly.
- **Story 2**: I want to know which mode I'm in so that I don't get confused.

### As a Developer
- **Story 3**: I want clear route separation so that navigation is predictable.

## Suggested Automated Tests

### Navigation Tests
1. **Navigation Link Tests**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Navigation', () => {
     it('renders Agent Conversations link', () => {
       render(<App />);
       expect(screen.getByText('Agent Conversations')).toBeInTheDocument();
     });
     
     it('navigates to agent conversations on click', () => {
       render(<App />);
       fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Agent Conversations'));
       expect(window.location.pathname).toContain('/agent-conversations');
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Route Separation Tests**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Route Separation', () => {
     it('note-taking routes distinct from agent routes', () => {
       // Verify route paths don't conflict
     });
   });
   ```

## Inherent Risks

### Medium Risk
1. **Route Conflicts**:
   - **Risk**: Routes conflict causing navigation issues
   - **Mitigation**: Clear route naming, testing, documentation

2. **Navigation Confusion**:
   - **Risk**: Users confused about which mode they're in
   - **Mitigation**: Clear breadcrumbs, page titles, visual indicators

### Low Risk
3. **Accessibility Issues**:
   - **Risk**: Navigation not accessible
   - **Mitigation**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
