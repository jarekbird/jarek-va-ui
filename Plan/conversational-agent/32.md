# Wire Agent Conversations into Global Navigation and Routing

## Scope
`jarek-va-ui`.

## Subtasks
- Add an "Agent Conversations" entry in the main navigation (for standalone list view).
- Add a **Dashboard** route (`/dashboard` or `/`) that becomes the primary entry point when ElevenLabs is enabled.
- Ensure note-taking and agent conversation list routes are clearly separated from, but consistent with, the dashboard (e.g., `/`, `/agent-conversations`, `/dashboard`).
- Provide clear breadcrumbs or page titles for each mode (Dashboard vs. list views).
- Guard Dashboard route with `VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ENABLED` feature flag.

## Desired Outcomes

### Primary Outcomes
1. **Dashboard as Primary View**: Dashboard route becomes the main entry point when ElevenLabs feature is enabled, showing all three sections (voice indicator, agent chat, note-taking) on one page.

2. **Navigation Integration**: Agent conversations accessible from main navigation (for standalone list view), and Dashboard accessible as primary view.

3. **Route Separation**: Clear separation between Dashboard, note-taking, and agent conversation list routes, preventing confusion.

4. **Clear Context**: Breadcrumbs and page titles make it clear which mode the user is in (Dashboard vs. list views).

5. **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation follows existing app patterns for familiarity, with Dashboard as the enhanced combined view.

### Success Criteria
- "Agent Conversations" in main navigation
- Routes clearly separated (/note-taking vs /agent-conversations)
- Breadcrumbs show correct context
- Page titles accurate
- Navigation works correctly
- No route conflicts
- Tests cover navigation flows

## User Stories

### As a User
- **Story 1**: I want to find agent conversations easily so that I can access them quickly.
- **Story 2**: I want to know which mode I'm in so that I don't get confused.

### As a Developer
- **Story 3**: I want clear route separation so that navigation is predictable.

## Suggested Automated Tests

### Navigation Tests
1. **Navigation Link Tests**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Navigation', () => {
     it('renders Agent Conversations link', () => {
       render(<App />);
       expect(screen.getByText('Agent Conversations')).toBeInTheDocument();
     });
     
     it('navigates to agent conversations on click', () => {
       render(<App />);
       fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Agent Conversations'));
       expect(window.location.pathname).toContain('/agent-conversations');
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Route Separation Tests**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Route Separation', () => {
     it('note-taking routes distinct from agent routes', () => {
       // Verify route paths don't conflict
     });
   });
   ```

## Inherent Risks

### Medium Risk
1. **Route Conflicts**:
   - **Risk**: Routes conflict causing navigation issues
   - **Mitigation**: Clear route naming, testing, documentation

2. **Navigation Confusion**:
   - **Risk**: Users confused about which mode they're in
   - **Mitigation**: Clear breadcrumbs, page titles, visual indicators

### Low Risk
3. **Accessibility Issues**:
   - **Risk**: Navigation not accessible
   - **Mitigation**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
