# Update Project Documentation

## Scope
`jarek-va-ui`, `elevenlabs-agent`, `cursor-runner`.

## Subtasks
- Update `README.md` files to describe:
  - Agent conversations.
  - Voice functionality.
  - New service (`elevenlabs-agent`) and its role.
- Document all new environment variables and how to configure them.
- Link to the master plan and this execution order file for future work.

## Desired Outcomes

### Primary Outcomes
1. **Complete Documentation**: All new features and services documented for developers and operators.

2. **Environment Variable Documentation**: Clear documentation of all environment variables with examples.

3. **Architecture Documentation**: Documentation explains how services work together.

4. **Future Reference**: Links to master plan and execution order for future development.

### Success Criteria
- README files updated
- Environment variables documented
- Architecture explained
- Links to plan files included
- Examples provided
- Setup instructions clear
- Troubleshooting section included

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- **Story 1**: I want complete documentation so that I can understand and work with the system.
- **Story 2**: I want environment variable docs so that I can set up the system quickly.

### As a New Team Member
- **Story 3**: I want architecture documentation so that I can understand how everything fits together.

## Suggested Automated Tests

### Documentation Tests
1. **Link Validation**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Documentation', () => {
     it('links to master plan exist', () => {
       // Verify links in README
     });
   });
   ```

## Inherent Risks

### Low Risk
1. **Documentation Drift**:
   - **Risk**: Documentation becomes outdated
   - **Mitigation**: Keep docs close to code, review in PRs, update regularly

2. **Incomplete Documentation**:
   - **Risk**: Some features not documented
   - **Mitigation**: Systematic review, checklist, peer review
