# Implement Redis Session Store Service

- **Scope:** `elevenlabs-agent`.
- **Subtasks:**
  - Implement `services/session-store.ts`:
    - Functions to set, get, and delete `elevenlabs:session:{conversation_id}` entries with TTL.
    - Store `sessionPayload`, `wsUrl`, `createdAt`, and `ttl` as described in the plan.
  - Enforce the “raw push-capable payload” rule and document it in code comments.
  - Add tests for TTL behavior and schema backwards compatibility.
