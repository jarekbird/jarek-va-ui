# TASK-7: Add tests for `ConversationDetailView`

**Section**: 3. Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
**Subsection**: 3.1 Navigation & Routing Components
**Task ID**: TASK-7

## Description

This task creates comprehensive unit tests for the `ConversationDetailView` component. This component displays a single conversation's details, handles loading/error states, and provides navigation back to the list view.

The tests will verify:
- Successful loading and rendering of conversation details
- Error handling with appropriate messages
- "Not found" state when conversation doesn't exist
- Back link navigation functionality
- Integration with MSW for API mocking
- Proper state management during loading

This component is the detail view counterpart to ConversationListView and requires thorough test coverage.

## Current State

- `ConversationDetailView` component exists at `src/components/ConversationDetailView.tsx`
- Component uses `getConversationById` from `src/api/conversations`
- Component uses React Router (`useParams`, `Link`)
- Component renders `Navigation`, `ConversationDetails`, `LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`
- Component handles loading, error, and not-found states
- No tests currently exist for this component
- MSW should be set up (from TASK-3) for API mocking

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `src/components/ConversationDetailView.tsx` (full file)
- `src/api/conversations.ts` for API client structure
- Existing component tests for patterns

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-5, and TASK-6 are complete.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `ConversationDetailView.tsx` component code
- [ ] Review `src/api/conversations.ts` to understand `getConversationById` API
- [ ] Review MSW handlers from TASK-3 for conversation detail endpoint
- [ ] Review existing component test patterns
- [ ] Understand Conversation type structure

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test file
  - [ ] Create `src/components/__tests__/ConversationDetailView.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary testing utilities and components
  - [ ] Set up MSW handlers for conversation detail API

- [ ] Step 2: Set up test structure
  - [ ] Create describe block for ConversationDetailView
  - [ ] Set up MSW handler for `GET /api/conversations/:id`
  - [ ] Create mock conversation data
  - [ ] Set up MemoryRouter with route params

- [ ] Step 3: Write tests for successful load
  - [ ] Test: Component loads conversation when valid `conversationId` param provided
  - [ ] Test: `getConversationById` is called with correct ID
  - [ ] Test: ConversationDetails component receives conversation prop
  - [ ] Test: Navigation component is rendered
  - [ ] Test: Back link is rendered and navigates to `/`
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner shown during load, then hidden

- [ ] Step 4: Write tests for error handling
  - [ ] Test: Backend error displays error message
  - [ ] Test: ErrorMessage component receives error message
  - [ ] Test: ConversationDetails not rendered when error occurs
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner hidden when error occurs

- [ ] Step 5: Write tests for not found state
  - [ ] Test: "Note session not found." message shown when conversation is null
  - [ ] Test: Message only shown when not loading and no error
  - [ ] Test: ConversationDetails not rendered when conversation is null

- [ ] Step 6: Write tests for routing behavior
  - [ ] Test: Component reads `conversationId` from URL params
  - [ ] Test: Back link navigates to `/` when clicked
  - [ ] Test: Component reloads when `conversationId` param changes
  - [ ] Test: Component handles missing `conversationId` param

- [ ] Step 7: Write tests for state management
  - [ ] Test: Loading state is true initially, then false after load
  - [ ] Test: Error state is cleared on successful load
  - [ ] Test: Conversation state updates when `onConversationUpdate` is called
  - [ ] Test: State resets when `conversationId` changes

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: API integration tested
  - `getConversationById` API call is tested
  - MSW handler works correctly
  - Error responses are handled
  - 404 responses show "not found" message

- [ ] Requirement 2: Routing behavior tested
  - URL parameter extraction works
  - Back link navigation works
  - Component responds to route changes

- [ ] Requirement 3: State management tested
  - Loading states are managed correctly
  - Error states are managed correctly
  - Conversation state updates correctly

- [ ] Requirement 4: Component integration tested
  - Child components are rendered correctly
  - Props are passed correctly to child components
  - Conditional rendering works

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case: `conversationId` param is missing
  - Component handles gracefully
  - No API call is made
  - Appropriate state is shown

- [ ] Handle case: API returns 404
  - "Note session not found." message is shown
  - No error is thrown
  - Component state is correct

- [ ] Handle case: API call fails with network error
  - Error message is displayed
  - User can see what went wrong

- [ ] Handle case: `conversationId` changes in URL
  - Component reloads conversation
  - Previous state is cleared
  - New conversation is loaded

### Testing

- [ ] Write all test cases for ConversationDetailView
- [ ] Use MSW to mock API responses
- [ ] Use MemoryRouter with different route params
- [ ] Test with userEvent for link clicks
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test -- ConversationDetailView.test.tsx`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Check test coverage

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to test file if needed
- [ ] Document test patterns used
- [ ] Add comments for complex test scenarios

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all ConversationDetailView functionality is tested
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Verify no regressions in other tests
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 3: Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-5, TASK-6 are complete
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1: Confirm local setup
  - TASK-2: Review existing test utilities
  - TASK-3: Introduce MSW (required for API mocking)
  - TASK-4: Configure coverage thresholds
  - TASK-5: Add tests for Navigation
  - TASK-6: Add tests for ConversationListView (related component)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use MSW handlers from TASK-3 for API mocking
  - Use MemoryRouter with `initialEntries` containing route params
  - Mock child components if needed to isolate tests
  - Test all state transitions (loading → loaded, loading → error, etc.)
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after prerequisites
- **Current State**: ConversationDetailView component exists but has no tests
