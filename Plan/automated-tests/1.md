# TASK-1: Confirm local setup

**Section**: 1. Baseline & Environment Setup
**Subsection**: 1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-1

## Description

This task establishes the baseline development environment for the jarek-va-ui automated testing implementation. Before any test development can begin, we must ensure that:

1. All project dependencies are properly installed
2. The TypeScript codebase compiles without errors
3. The existing test suite runs successfully

This is a foundational task that must be completed before any other testing work can proceed. It verifies that the development environment is correctly configured and that the current codebase is in a stable state.

## Current State

- The project uses npm for package management
- TypeScript is configured via `tsconfig.json`
- Vitest is configured as the test runner
- Existing tests are located in `src/__tests__/`, `src/components/__tests__/`, `src/api/__tests__/`, etc.
- The project may have dependencies that need to be installed or updated

**Important**: This task has no prerequisites and must be completed before any other tasks in the execution order.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Navigate to the project root directory: `/Users/jarekbird/Documents/cursor-working-directory/virtual-assistant/jarek-va-ui`
- [ ] Verify that `package.json` exists and contains the necessary scripts
- [ ] Check that `node_modules/` directory exists (or will be created)
- [ ] Review `package.json` to understand project dependencies

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Install dependencies
  - [ ] Run `npm install` in the project root
  - [ ] Verify that the command completes without errors
  - [ ] Confirm that `node_modules/` directory is populated
  - [ ] Check for any warnings or errors in the installation output
  - [ ] If installation fails, investigate and resolve dependency conflicts

- [ ] Step 2: Run type checking
  - [ ] Execute `npm run type-check`
  - [ ] Review all TypeScript compilation errors
  - [ ] Fix any blocking type errors that prevent compilation
  - [ ] Verify that `npm run type-check` completes with exit code 0
  - [ ] Document any non-blocking warnings for future reference

- [ ] Step 3: Run existing test suite
  - [ ] Execute `npm test` (or `npm run test` if that's the script name)
  - [ ] Wait for all tests to complete
  - [ ] Verify that all existing tests pass
  - [ ] If any tests fail, investigate and fix the issues
  - [ ] Document the current test count and pass rate
  - [ ] Ensure test suite completes in a reasonable time

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Dependencies installed successfully
  - All packages listed in `package.json` dependencies and devDependencies are installed
  - No critical errors during installation
  - `node_modules/` directory contains expected packages

- [ ] Requirement 2: TypeScript compilation succeeds
  - `npm run type-check` exits with code 0
  - No blocking type errors
  - All source files compile successfully

- [ ] Requirement 3: Existing tests pass
  - All tests in the current test suite pass
  - Test runner completes successfully
  - No test failures or timeouts

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case: npm install fails due to network issues
  - Retry installation
  - Check network connectivity
  - Verify npm registry configuration

- [ ] Handle case: TypeScript errors are present
  - Identify all type errors
  - Prioritize blocking errors
  - Fix errors or document as known issues

- [ ] Handle case: Tests fail
  - Identify failing tests
  - Determine if failures are due to environment issues
  - Fix or document test failures

- [ ] Handle case: Missing scripts in package.json
  - Verify script names match expected commands
  - Check package.json for correct script definitions

### Testing

- [ ] Verify npm install completed successfully
  - Check that `node_modules/` exists and contains packages
  - Verify no critical errors in installation output

- [ ] Verify type checking passes
  - Run `npm run type-check` and confirm exit code 0
  - Review output for any warnings

- [ ] Verify test suite passes
  - Run `npm test` and confirm all tests pass
  - Note the number of tests and their status

### Documentation

- [ ] Document any issues encountered during setup
- [ ] Note the current test count and status
- [ ] Record any warnings or non-critical issues

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Verify all existing tests pass
- [ ] Verify development environment is ready for test development

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 1: Baseline & Environment Setup
- **Execution Timing**: This is the first task and must be completed before all other tasks
- **Dependencies**: None - this is the entry point task
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - If npm install fails, check Node.js and npm versions
  - If type-check fails, prioritize fixing blocking errors
  - If tests fail, determine if it's an environment issue or code issue
- **Task Independence**: This task can be completed independently
- **Current State**: Project may or may not have dependencies installed

## Related Tasks

- Previous: None (this is the first task)
- Next: TASK-2 (Review existing test utilities)
- Dependencies: None
- Related: None

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASK

**Description**: This task involves installing dependencies and verifying the development environment setup.

**Definition of Done**: 

1. **All operations complete successfully**:
   - `npm install` completes without errors
   - `npm run type-check` completes with exit code 0 (no blocking errors)
   - `npm test` completes with all tests passing

2. **Expected artifacts created**:
   - `node_modules/` directory exists and is populated
   - TypeScript compilation succeeds
   - Test suite runs and passes

3. **Code committed and pushed**:
   - If any fixes were made to resolve type errors or test failures, those changes must be committed
   - Commit message: `chore: confirm local setup and fix any blocking issues`
   - Code pushed to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`

4. **User Story** (as a developer):
   - **As a** developer working on automated tests
   - **I want** the development environment to be properly set up with all dependencies installed
   - **So that** I can run tests and develop new test code without environment issues

5. **Automated Tests**:
   - No new tests are written in this task
   - All existing tests must pass: `npm test` must complete successfully
   - Test verification: The test suite runs without errors or failures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ `npm install` completes successfully
- ✅ `npm run type-check` passes with no blocking errors
- ✅ `npm test` runs and all tests pass
- ✅ Any fixes made are committed and pushed to origin
- ✅ Development environment is ready for test development

**If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete.**
