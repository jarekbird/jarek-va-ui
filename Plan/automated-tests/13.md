# TASK-13: Add tests for `TaskListView`

**Section**: 3. Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
**Subsection**: 3.3 Task & Dashboard Components
**Task ID**: TASK-13

## Description

This task creates comprehensive unit tests for the `TaskListView` component. This component displays a list of tasks by loading them from the API and rendering them via the `TaskList` component.

The tests will verify:
- Component loads tasks on mount via `listTasks` API
- Tasks are rendered via `TaskList` component
- Active task ID is derived from URL
- Error handling displays appropriate messages
- Empty state is displayed when no tasks
- Loading states are managed correctly
- Integration with MSW for API mocking

This is a relatively simple view component that orchestrates task loading and display.

## Current State

- `TaskListView` component exists at `src/components/TaskListView.tsx`
- Component uses `listTasks` from `src/api/tasks`
- Component uses React Router (`useLocation`)
- Component renders `Navigation`, `TaskList`, `LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`
- Component handles loading, error, and empty states
- No tests currently exist for this component
- MSW should be set up (from TASK-3) for API mocking

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `src/components/TaskListView.tsx` (full file)
- `src/api/tasks.ts` for API client structure
- `src/components/__tests__/ConversationListView.test.tsx` for similar patterns

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-12 are complete.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `TaskListView.tsx` component code
- [ ] Review `src/api/tasks.ts` to understand `listTasks` API
- [ ] Review MSW handlers from TASK-3 for tasks endpoints
- [ ] Review `ConversationListView.test.tsx` for similar test patterns
- [ ] Understand Task type structure

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test file
  - [ ] Create `src/components/__tests__/TaskListView.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary testing utilities and components
  - [ ] Set up MSW handlers for tasks API

- [ ] Step 2: Set up test structure
  - [ ] Create describe block for TaskListView
  - [ ] Set up MSW handler for `GET /api/tasks`
  - [ ] Create mock task data
  - [ ] Set up MemoryRouter for routing tests

- [ ] Step 3: Write tests for successful load
  - [ ] Test: Component calls `listTasks` on mount
  - [ ] Test: Tasks are rendered via `TaskList` component
  - [ ] Test: `TaskList` receives correct props (tasks, activeTaskId, onSelectTask)
  - [ ] Test: Navigation component is rendered
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner shown during load, then hidden
  - [ ] Test: Heading "Tasks" is displayed

- [ ] Step 4: Write tests for active task ID from URL
  - [ ] Test: `activeTaskId` is derived from URL when on `/tasks/:id`
  - [ ] Test: `activeTaskId` is null when not on task detail route
  - [ ] Test: URL parsing extracts task ID correctly
  - [ ] Test: `activeTaskId` is passed to `TaskList`

- [ ] Step 5: Write tests for error handling
  - [ ] Test: Network error displays error message
  - [ ] Test: ErrorMessage component receives error message
  - [ ] Test: TaskList not rendered when error occurs
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner hidden when error occurs

- [ ] Step 6: Write tests for empty state
  - [ ] Test: "No tasks found." message shown when tasks array is empty
  - [ ] Test: Empty state only shown when not loading and no error
  - [ ] Test: TaskList not rendered when empty

- [ ] Step 7: Write tests for task selection
  - [ ] Test: `handleSelectTask` is passed to `TaskList`
  - [ ] Test: Task selection doesn't cause navigation (handled by Link in TaskList)

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: API integration tested
  - `listTasks` API call is tested
  - MSW handlers work correctly
  - Error responses are handled

- [ ] Requirement 2: Component integration tested
  - `TaskList` component receives correct props
  - Navigation component is rendered
  - Loading and error components are rendered appropriately

- [ ] Requirement 3: State management tested
  - Loading states are managed correctly
  - Error states are managed correctly
  - Empty states are managed correctly

- [ ] Requirement 4: URL-based active task tested
  - Active task ID is extracted from URL correctly
  - Active task ID is passed to TaskList

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case: API returns empty array
  - Empty state is displayed
  - No errors thrown

- [ ] Handle case: API call fails
  - Error message is displayed
  - Component doesn't crash

- [ ] Handle case: Invalid task ID in URL
  - Component handles gracefully
  - No errors thrown

- [ ] Handle case: URL changes
  - Active task ID updates
  - Component re-renders correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Write all test cases for TaskListView
- [ ] Use MSW to mock API responses
- [ ] Use MemoryRouter with different routes
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test -- TaskListView.test.tsx`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Check test coverage

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to test file if needed
- [ ] Document test patterns used
- [ ] Add comments for complex test scenarios

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all TaskListView functionality is tested
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Verify no regressions in other tests
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 3: Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-12 are complete
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1: Confirm local setup
  - TASK-2: Review existing test utilities
  - TASK-3: Introduce MSW (required for API mocking)
  - TASK-4: Configure coverage thresholds
  - TASK-12: Add tests for TaskList (uses this component)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use MSW handlers from TASK-3 for API mocking
  - Use MemoryRouter with different `initialEntries` for routing tests
  - Mock `TaskList` component if needed to isolate tests
  - Test URL-based active task ID extraction
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after prerequisites
- **Current State**: TaskListView component exists but has no tests
