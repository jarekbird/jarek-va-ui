# TASK-22.3: Add tests for `src/api/tasks.ts` - `getTaskById` / `fetchTask` function

**Section**: 4. Unit Tests for Untested API Clients (Phase 2B)
**Subsection**: 4.3 Tasks API Client
**Task ID**: TASK-22.3
**Parent Task**: TASK-22
**Order**: 3 of 4

## Description

This task creates comprehensive unit tests for the `getTaskById` / `fetchTask` function in the `src/api/tasks.ts` API client module. This function retrieves a single task by ID.

The tests will verify:
- Successful JSON responses
- 404 responses (task not found)
- Other error responses

## Current State

- Test file should exist (from TASK-22.1)
- `getTaskById` / `fetchTask` function exists in `src/api/tasks.ts`
- Function handles 404 errors specially
- No tests currently exist for this function

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-22.1 is complete.

## Checklist

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Write tests for successful responses
  - [ ] Test: Successful JSON response returns task object
  - [ ] Test: Response with correct content-type is parsed
  - [ ] Test: Task structure is correct

- [ ] Step 2: Write tests for 404 response
  - [ ] Test: 404 response throws "Task not found" error
  - [ ] Test: Error message is clear and specific
  - [ ] Test: Error is thrown correctly

- [ ] Step 3: Write tests for other errors
  - [ ] Test: Other errors (4xx/5xx) return error with status text
  - [ ] Test: Error messages are clear

### Testing

- [ ] Write all test cases for `getTaskById` / `fetchTask`
- [ ] Use MSW to mock API responses
- [ ] Run tests and verify all pass
