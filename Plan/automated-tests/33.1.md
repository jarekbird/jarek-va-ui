# TASK-33.1: Implement E2E tests for conversation flows

**Section**: 7. E2E, Accessibility, and Regression Tests (Phase 4)
**Subsection**: 7.2 Core E2E Test Implementation
**Task ID**: TASK-33.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-33
**Order**: 1 of 5

## Description

This task implements end-to-end (E2E) tests for conversation flows in the application. These tests verify that users can list conversations, view conversation details, navigate between views, and create new conversations.

## Current State

- E2E framework should be set up (from TASK-32)
- Application can be built and run
- Conversation flows exist in the application
- No E2E tests for conversations currently exist

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-32 is complete.

## Checklist

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create E2E test file
  - [ ] Create `e2e/conversations.spec.ts` (or `.test.ts` for Playwright)
  - [ ] Set up test structure with E2E framework

- [ ] Step 2: Write E2E tests for conversation flows
  - [ ] Test: Visit root, confirm conversation list loads
  - [ ] Test: Conversations are displayed in list
  - [ ] Test: Click conversation to open detail view
  - [ ] Test: Conversation detail displays correctly
  - [ ] Test: Navigate back to list
  - [ ] Test: Create new conversation
  - [ ] Test: New conversation appears in list

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] List loads correctly
- [ ] Detail view works correctly
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] Creation works correctly

### Testing

- [ ] Write all E2E test cases for conversations
- [ ] Use proper wait strategies
- [ ] Use semantic selectors
- [ ] Run tests: `npm run e2e`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
