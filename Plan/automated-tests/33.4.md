# TASK-33.4: Implement E2E tests for working directory

**Section**: 7. E2E, Accessibility, and Regression Tests (Phase 4)
**Subsection**: 7.2 Core E2E Test Implementation
**Task ID**: TASK-33.4
**Parent Task**: TASK-33
**Order**: 4 of 5

## Description

This task implements end-to-end (E2E) tests for the working directory browser. These tests verify that the file tree displays correctly and that expand/collapse functionality works.

## Current State

- E2E framework should be set up (from TASK-32)
- Working directory browser exists in the application
- No E2E tests for working directory currently exist

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-32 is complete.

## Checklist
