# TASK-16: Add tests for `TaskManagementPanel`

**Section**: 3. Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
**Subsection**: 3.3 Task & Dashboard Components
**Task ID**: TASK-16

## Description

This task creates comprehensive unit tests for the `TaskManagementPanel` component. This component displays tasks in a panel format with refresh functionality and exposes a `refresh()` method via ref for parent components to trigger.

The tests will verify:
- Component loads tasks on mount via `listTasks` API (exactly once)
- Refresh button triggers task reload
- Loading, error, empty, and populated states
- `refresh()` method exposed via ref works correctly
- Component integration with TaskList
- Integration with MSW for API mocking

This component uses `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` to expose methods to parent components.

## Current State

- `TaskManagementPanel` component exists at `src/components/TaskManagementPanel.tsx`
- Component uses `listTasks` from `src/api/tasks`
- Component uses `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` to expose `refresh()` method
- Component renders `TaskList`, `LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`
- Component has refresh button
- Component handles loading, error, and empty states
- No tests currently exist for this component
- MSW should be set up (from TASK-3) for API mocking

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `src/components/TaskManagementPanel.tsx` (full file)
- `src/api/tasks.ts` for API client structure
- Existing ref-based component tests for patterns

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-12 are complete.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `TaskManagementPanel.tsx` component code
- [ ] Review `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` usage
- [ ] Review `src/api/tasks.ts` to understand `listTasks` API
- [ ] Review MSW handlers from TASK-3 for tasks endpoints
- [ ] Understand ref-based component testing patterns

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test file
  - [ ] Create `src/components/__tests__/TaskManagementPanel.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary testing utilities and components
  - [ ] Set up MSW handlers for tasks API

- [ ] Step 2: Set up test structure
  - [ ] Create describe block for TaskManagementPanel
  - [ ] Set up MSW handler for `GET /api/tasks`
  - [ ] Create mock task data
  - [ ] Set up ref for testing `refresh()` method

- [ ] Step 3: Write tests for initial load
  - [ ] Test: Component calls `listTasks` exactly once on mount
  - [ ] Test: Tasks are rendered via `TaskList` component
  - [ ] Test: `TaskList` receives correct props
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner shown during initial load, then hidden
  - [ ] Test: Header with "Tasks" title is displayed
  - [ ] Test: Refresh button is rendered

- [ ] Step 4: Write tests for refresh button
  - [ ] Test: Clicking refresh button calls `listTasks` again
  - [ ] Test: Refresh button triggers task reload
  - [ ] Test: UI updates after refresh
  - [ ] Test: Loading state during refresh (if applicable)

- [ ] Step 5: Write tests for ref-based refresh
  - [ ] Test: `refresh()` method is exposed via ref
  - [ ] Test: Calling `refresh()` via ref calls `listTasks`
  - [ ] Test: Calling `refresh()` updates tasks
  - [ ] Test: Ref can be used by parent component

- [ ] Step 6: Write tests for loading state
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner shown when loading and no tasks
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner hidden after load completes
  - [ ] Test: Tasks not shown while loading

- [ ] Step 7: Write tests for error state
  - [ ] Test: Error message displayed when API fails
  - [ ] Test: ErrorMessage component receives error message
  - [ ] Test: TaskList not rendered when error occurs
  - [ ] Test: Tasks cleared on error

- [ ] Step 8: Write tests for empty state
  - [ ] Test: "No tasks found. Tasks are created by cursor-cli." message shown when empty
  - [ ] Test: Empty state only shown when not loading and no error
  - [ ] Test: TaskList not rendered when empty

- [ ] Step 9: Write tests for populated state
  - [ ] Test: Tasks are displayed when loaded successfully
  - [ ] Test: TaskList receives tasks array
  - [ ] Test: Multiple tasks are rendered correctly

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: API integration tested
  - `listTasks` API call is tested
  - API is called exactly once on mount
  - MSW handlers work correctly
  - Error responses are handled

- [ ] Requirement 2: Refresh functionality tested
  - Refresh button works
  - Ref-based refresh works
  - Both methods trigger API reload

- [ ] Requirement 3: State management tested
  - Loading states are managed correctly
  - Error states are managed correctly
  - Empty states are managed correctly
  - Populated states are managed correctly

- [ ] Requirement 4: Ref API tested
  - `refresh()` method is exposed
  - Method works correctly
  - Ref can be used by parent

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case: API returns empty array
  - Empty state is displayed
  - No errors thrown

- [ ] Handle case: API call fails
  - Error message is displayed
  - Component doesn't crash
  - Tasks are cleared

- [ ] Handle case: Multiple rapid refresh clicks
  - Component handles gracefully
  - No duplicate API calls (or handles them correctly)

- [ ] Handle case: Ref is not provided
  - Component still works
  - No errors thrown

### Testing

- [ ] Write all test cases for TaskManagementPanel
- [ ] Use MSW to mock API responses
- [ ] Use `createRef` or `useRef` to test ref functionality
- [ ] Use userEvent for button clicks
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test -- TaskManagementPanel.test.tsx`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Check test coverage

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to test file if needed
- [ ] Document test patterns used
- [ ] Add comments for ref testing patterns
- [ ] Add comments for complex test scenarios

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all TaskManagementPanel functionality is tested
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Verify no regressions in other tests
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 3: Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-12 are complete
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1: Confirm local setup
  - TASK-2: Review existing test utilities
  - TASK-3: Introduce MSW (required for API mocking)
  - TASK-4: Configure coverage thresholds
  - TASK-12: Add tests for TaskList (uses this component)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use MSW handlers from TASK-3 for API mocking
  - Test ref-based API using `createRef` or `useRef` in tests
  - Verify `listTasks` is called exactly once on mount
  - Mock `TaskList` component if needed to isolate tests
  - Test all state transitions
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after prerequisites
- **Current State**: TaskManagementPanel component exists but has no tests
