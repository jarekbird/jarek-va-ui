# TASK-33.5: Implement E2E tests for simple voice flow

**Section**: 7. E2E, Accessibility, and Regression Tests (Phase 4)
**Subsection**: 7.2 Core E2E Test Implementation
**Task ID**: TASK-33.5
**Parent Task**: TASK-33
**Order**: 5 of 5

## Description

This task implements end-to-end (E2E) tests for the simple voice flow. These tests verify that users can connect and disconnect from voice conversations (happy path only).

## Current State

- E2E framework should be set up (from TASK-32)
- Voice flow exists in the application
- No E2E tests for voice flow currently exist

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-32 is complete.

## Checklist

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create E2E test file
  - [ ] Create `e2e/voice.spec.ts`
  - [ ] Set up test structure

- [ ] Step 2: Write E2E tests for simple voice flow
  - [ ] Test: With configured backend and agent, select an agent conversation
  - [ ] Test: Click connect button
  - [ ] Test: Verify visible status messages (connected state)
  - [ ] Test: Click disconnect button
  - [ ] Test: Verify visible status messages (disconnected state)
  - [ ] Test: Happy path only (no error scenarios)

### Testing

- [ ] Write all E2E test cases for voice flow
- [ ] Use proper wait strategies
- [ ] Run tests and verify all pass
