# TASK-20.2: Add tests for `src/api/queues.ts` - `getQueueInfo` function

**Section**: 4. Unit Tests for Untested API Clients (Phase 2B)
**Subsection**: 4.1 Queue API Client
**Task ID**: TASK-20.2
**Parent Task**: TASK-20
**Order**: 2 of 2

## Description

This task creates comprehensive unit tests for the `getQueueInfo` function in the `src/api/queues.ts` API client module. This function retrieves information about a specific Bull MQ queue by name.

The tests will verify:
- Successful JSON responses
- 404 responses (queue not found)
- Non-JSON responses
- Other error responses (4xx/5xx)
- Error message extraction

## Current State

- Test file should exist (from TASK-20.1)
- `getQueueInfo` function exists in `src/api/queues.ts`
- Function handles 404 errors specially
- No tests currently exist for this function

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-20.1 is complete.

## Checklist

- [ ] Step 1: Add tests for successful responses
  - [ ] Test: Successful JSON response returns queue info
  - [ ] Test: Response with correct content-type is parsed
  - [ ] Test: Queue info structure is correct
  - [ ] Test: All queue fields are present

- [ ] Step 2: Write tests for 404 response
  - [ ] Test: 404 response throws "Queue not found" error
  - [ ] Test: Error message is clear and specific

- [ ] Step 3: Write tests for non-JSON responses
  - [ ] Test: Non-JSON response throws error
  - [ ] Test: Error message includes content-type information

- [ ] Step 4: Write tests for other error responses
  - [ ] Test: 4xx response (not 404) returns error with server message
  - [ ] Test: 5xx response returns error with server message

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] 404 handling tested specially
- [ ] All error scenarios tested
- [ ] Error messages are clear

### Testing

- [ ] Write all test cases for `getQueueInfo`
- [ ] Use MSW to mock API responses
