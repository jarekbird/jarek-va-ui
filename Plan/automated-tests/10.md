# TASK-10: Add tests for `AgentConversationDetailView`

**Section**: 3. Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
**Subsection**: 3.2 Agent Conversation Components
**Task ID**: TASK-10

## Description

This task creates comprehensive unit tests for the `AgentConversationDetailView` component. This component displays a single agent conversation's details with automatic polling for updates and manual refresh capability.

The tests will verify:
- Successful loading and rendering of conversation details
- Automatic polling for new messages (every 3 seconds)
- Polling stops on unmount
- Manual refresh functionality
- Error handling during load and refresh
- Back link navigation
- Integration with MSW for API mocking

This component requires special attention to polling behavior and timer management.

## Current State

- `AgentConversationDetailView` component exists at `src/components/AgentConversationDetailView.tsx`
- Component uses `getAgentConversation` from `src/api/agent-conversations`
- Component implements polling with 3-second interval
- Component uses React Router (`useParams`, `Link`)
- Component renders `Navigation`, `AgentConversationDetails`, `LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`
- Component has manual refresh button
- No tests currently exist for this component
- MSW should be set up (from TASK-3) for API mocking

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `src/components/AgentConversationDetailView.tsx` (full file)
- `src/api/agent-conversations.ts` for API client structure
- `src/components/__tests__/ConversationDetailView.test.tsx` for similar patterns

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-9 are complete.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `AgentConversationDetailView.tsx` component code
- [ ] Review polling implementation (setInterval, cleanup)
- [ ] Review `src/api/agent-conversations.ts` to understand `getAgentConversation` API
- [ ] Review MSW handlers from TASK-3 for agent conversation detail endpoint
- [ ] Review Vitest fake timers documentation

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create test file
  - [ ] Create `src/components/__tests__/AgentConversationDetailView.test.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary testing utilities and components
  - [ ] Set up MSW handlers for agent conversation detail API

- [ ] Step 2: Set up test structure
  - [ ] Create describe block for AgentConversationDetailView
  - [ ] Set up MSW handler for `GET /api/agent-conversations/:id`
  - [ ] Create mock agent conversation data
  - [ ] Set up MemoryRouter with route params
  - [ ] Configure fake timers using `vi.useFakeTimers()`

- [ ] Step 3: Write tests for successful load
  - [ ] Test: Component loads conversation when valid `conversationId` param provided
  - [ ] Test: `getAgentConversation` is called with correct ID
  - [ ] Test: `AgentConversationDetails` component receives conversation prop
  - [ ] Test: Navigation component is rendered
  - [ ] Test: Back link is rendered and navigates to `/agent-conversations`
  - [ ] Test: LoadingSpinner shown during load, then hidden
  - [ ] Test: "Live updates" indicator shown when polling is active

- [ ] Step 4: Write tests for polling behavior
  - [ ] Test: After initial load, polling interval is scheduled (3 seconds)
  - [ ] Test: Polling calls `getAgentConversation` at intervals
  - [ ] Test: When new messages arrive (different from current), conversation updates
  - [ ] Test: When messages haven't changed, conversation doesn't update (no unnecessary re-renders)
  - [ ] Test: Polling stops on component unmount
  - [ ] Test: Polling doesn't start if conversation not loaded
  - [ ] Test: Polling doesn't start if still loading

- [ ] Step 5: Write tests for manual refresh
  - [ ] Test: "Refresh" button triggers `getAgentConversation`
  - [ ] Test: Button shows "Refreshing..." during refresh
  - [ ] Test: Button is disabled during refresh
  - [ ] Test: Conversation updates after successful refresh
  - [ ] Test: Error during refresh shows error message
  - [ ] Test: Error message is displayed correctly

- [ ] Step 6: Write tests for error handling
  - [ ] Test: Backend error during load displays error message
  - [ ] Test: ErrorMessage component receives error message
  - [ ] Test: AgentConversationDetails not rendered when error occurs
  - [ ] Test: Polling doesn't start when error occurs
  - [ ] Test: Network errors are handled gracefully

- [ ] Step 7: Write tests for routing behavior
  - [ ] Test: Component reads `conversationId` from URL params
  - [ ] Test: Back link navigates to `/agent-conversations` when clicked
  - [ ] Test: Component reloads when `conversationId` param changes
  - [ ] Test: Component handles missing `conversationId` param

- [ ] Step 8: Write tests for state management
  - [ ] Test: Loading state is true initially, then false after load
  - [ ] Test: Error state is cleared on successful load
  - [ ] Test: Conversation state updates when polling detects changes
  - [ ] Test: State resets when `conversationId` changes

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: API integration tested
  - `getAgentConversation` API call is tested
  - MSW handler works correctly
  - Error responses are handled

- [ ] Requirement 2: Polling behavior tested
  - Polling interval is correct (3 seconds)
  - Polling updates conversation when messages change
  - Polling doesn't update when messages unchanged
  - Polling cleanup works on unmount

- [ ] Requirement 3: Manual refresh tested
  - Refresh button works correctly
  - Loading state during refresh
  - Error handling during refresh

- [ ] Requirement 4: Routing behavior tested
  - URL parameter extraction works
  - Back link navigation works
  - Component responds to route changes

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case: `conversationId` param is missing
  - Component handles gracefully
  - No API call is made
  - No polling starts

- [ ] Handle case: API returns 404
  - Error message is shown
  - No polling starts
  - Component state is correct

- [ ] Handle case: Polling request fails
  - Error is logged but doesn't disrupt UI
  - Polling continues (doesn't stop)
  - User experience is not disrupted

- [ ] Handle case: `conversationId` changes in URL
  - Component stops old polling
  - Component reloads new conversation
  - New polling starts for new conversation

- [ ] Handle case: Rapid refresh clicks
  - Only one refresh happens at a time
  - Button is disabled during refresh
  - No duplicate API calls

### Testing

- [ ] Write all test cases for AgentConversationDetailView
- [ ] Use MSW to mock API responses
- [ ] Use fake timers (`vi.useFakeTimers()`) for polling tests
- [ ] Use MemoryRouter with different route params
- [ ] Test with userEvent for button clicks
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test -- AgentConversationDetailView.test.tsx`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Check test coverage

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to test file if needed
- [ ] Document fake timer usage patterns
- [ ] Document polling test patterns
- [ ] Add comments for complex test scenarios

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all AgentConversationDetailView functionality is tested
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Verify no regressions in other tests
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Verify fake timers are properly cleaned up

## Notes

- This task is part of Section 3: Unit Tests for Untested Components (Phase 2A)
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TASK-4, TASK-9 are complete
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1: Confirm local setup
  - TASK-2: Review existing test utilities
  - TASK-3: Introduce MSW (required for API mocking)
  - TASK-4: Configure coverage thresholds
  - TASK-9: Add tests for AgentConversationListView (related component)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use fake timers (`vi.useFakeTimers()`) to control polling intervals
  - Use `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` to advance time in tests
  - Clean up fake timers after each test (`vi.useRealTimers()`)
  - Test that polling only updates when messages actually change
  - Test polling cleanup on unmount
  - Use MSW handlers from TASK-3 for API mocking
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after prerequisites
- **Current State**: AgentConversationDetailView component exists but has no tests
